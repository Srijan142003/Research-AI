# Research-AI

Research-AI is a Python-based project designed to help researchers and students bridge ideas and gaps from research papers across various topics. Users can search for topics of their own interest, discover relevant research, and gain insights to further their studies or investigations.

This project utilizes the Gemini API for advanced language understanding and leverages the CORE research database, providing access to millions of academic papers.

## Features

- **Topic-Based Search:** Find research papers and topics tailored to your interests.
- **Bridging Ideas:** Get AI-driven suggestions to connect ideas and identify gaps in the literature.
- **Access to Millions of Papers:** Powered by the CORE API, giving you a vast academic resource pool.
- **Natural Language Understanding:** Uses Gemini API for smart analysis and recommendations.
- **User-Friendly:** Built for both students and researchers to accelerate their work.
